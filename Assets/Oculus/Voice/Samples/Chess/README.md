# Restoring Wit.ai app from zip file

To get the chessboard demo app working, you need to train wit.ai with proper intents. The easiest way is to use the backup zip file provided in the demo folder. 

- Navigate to https://wit.ai/apps

- Click on New App

- From the openned dialogue, click on Browse and pick "Chess Demo - Wit.ai Config.zip" from the Demo/Data folder. 

- Now navigate to the Management -> Settings and copy the server token and paste it inside "Chess Demo with Conduit- WitConfiguration" in Unity Editor.

- You can now play the scene and move the chess piece using your voice.
