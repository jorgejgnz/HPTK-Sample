/// <summary>
/// This class is used to affect the transformation of scene anchors.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// When a scene anchor is instantiated, a <seealso cref="OVRScenePlane"/> and/or
/// <seealso cref="OVRSceneVolume"/> is added if the underlying scene anchor
/// as a 2D and/or 3D component, respectively.
///
/// Both <seealso cref="OVRScenePlane"/> and <seealso cref="OVRSceneVolume"/>
/// provide the option to scale and offset all child objects, so that they
/// align with the dimensions of the scene anchor.
///
/// If this type exists on the scene anchor's child objects, then a scale/offset
/// will only be performed if the type aligns.
///
/// Note: if this type does not exist on the scene anchor's child objects,
/// then the <seealso cref="OVRSceneVolume"/> will take precedence for
/// scaling/offseting child objects.
/// </remarks>
